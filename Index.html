				<h2>🎼 My Hobbies 🎼</h2>
				<p>I'm passionate about music. I love to sing, I was a singer in a band for 5 years. I have also been playing the piano since I was 7 years old. I love listening to different styles of music and discovering new artists. I also like to practice outdoor sports like cycling and skiing. This is an opportunity for me to practice another of my hobbies which is photography.

				<p>In my second year of international business, I did an internship with the beaumanoir group. The group, which has the brands cache-cache, bonobo, bréal and morgan, is the French leader in the fashion industry. I worked there as a purchasing assistant in the mute and production department. This internship allowed me to develop my knowledge in the field of purchasing and good stress management. It was a revelation for me, I want to work in the fashion industry as a buyer. </p>

				<p>Finally, during the summers 2019 and 2020, I worked in a retirement home as a hotel agent. This environment was totally unknown to me before and frightened me. How was I going to cope, me who had never had any training or even experience with the elderly? I took my courage in both hands and finally discovered a great universe, a place where each person has a story, a journey to tell. </p>
